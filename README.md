# Book Store API

A lightweight ASP.NET Core Web API for managing books and authors, built with **Clean Architecture** for scalability and maintainability.

## Features
- **RESTful** endpoints for books and authors
- **Clean Architecture** with separation of concerns
- **Entity Framework Core** with PostgreSQL
- **Dependency Injection**

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Avalonix01/Book-Store`
2. Configure the database connection string in `appsettings.json`
3. Update sensitive values in `docker-compose.yml`
4. Launch services: `docker-compose up`
5. Apply migrations: `dotnet ef database update`
6. Run the API: `dotnet run`

## Project Purpose
This API demonstrates my skills in designing maintainable .NET applications with **Clean Architecture**, efficient database management using **Entity Framework Core** with **PostgreSQL**, and containerized deployment with **Docker**.
